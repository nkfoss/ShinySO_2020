# R-Shiny + StackOverflow (2020)

This repo is for an R-Shiny application for exploring data from the 2020 StackOverflow user-survey.

Shiny is an R library that allows you to create interactive web apps with R. Combining Shiny with R's other packages, the user can graphically explore data and visually uncover trends.

## Introduction

This project was done as an exploratory tool for me and other developers. Specifically, which technologies in the 'development' field are developers excited about and want to learn? Furthermore, which type of developers are excited about these technologies, and how do they compare to all developers as a whole?

## Technologies

- [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) 
- [ggplot2](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html) (a library for creating awesome graphs)
